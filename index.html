        Solving Two-Step Equations
    </h1>
    <p>
        To solve a two-step equation, you must do two calculations per equation to get to the answer,
    </p>
    <p>
        Typically step one is to undo the addition or subtraction.<br>
        Step two is to undo any multiplication or division in the problem. This will result in the final answer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two-step equations are usually created by taking one-step equations and adding or subtracting a number to both sides.
        Usually the multiplication problems are used from the one-step equations to produce the two step equation.

        Let's look at an example:<br>
        <img src="images/img1.png" alt="ex1" id="img1" />
        <img src="images/img2.png" alt="ex1" id="img2" />
        The answer is m = 2.

        Let's look at an example:<br>
        <img src="images/img3.png" alt="ex2" id="img3" />
        <img src="images/img4.png" alt="ex2" id="img4" />
        The answer is d = 3.

        <img src="images/img5.png" alt="ex3" id="img5" />
        <img src="images/img6.png" alt="ex3" id="img6" />
        The answer is r = 3.

        <img src="images/img7.png" alt="ex4" id="img7" />
        <img src="images/img8.png" alt="ex4" id="img8" />
        The answer is w = 4.

        Let's look at an example:<br>
        <img src="images/img9.png" alt="ex5" id="img9" />
        <img src="images/img10.png" alt="ex5" id="img10" />
        The answer is x = 3.

    Rule: Notice the same step is used to begin each problem: undoing the addition or subtraction by using the inverse operation.
    Then dividing both sides by the coefficient of each variable will result in the answer.<br>
    To check your answer, substitute its value into the original equation and simplify. Both sides of the equation must simplify to equal the same number if you got the correct answer.

    Try the following examples. Be sure to check your solution.<br>
    1)  4x + 8 = 20<br>
    2)  3w - 6 = 6<br>
    3)  6t + 4 = 34<br>
    4)  5r + 6 = 41<br>
    5)  -2w + 5 = -7<br>
